# stats girl bot

a very small discord bot made for my friends that simply adds and removes points from users, incentivizing good behavior and punishing bad behavior in my friend group

also has a few other commands that are just for fun

## commands

- /good
- /bad
- /points
- /lb
- /hovhannes
- /reset (soon will only be allowed with admin perms)

## current uses

- discord.js
- node.js
- sqlite3
- axios (for monkeytype api)
- deepl translate api

## planned uses

- ~~deepl translate~~
- chartjs with quickchart.io



## a true upgrade from banobot

- actually works
- actually organized (sort of)
- actually good (not really though)
- actually has and makes use of a database
- actually has a good command handler
- actually has a good event handler

## sad

typescript sucks
don't ever use it
please don't
i'm begging you
i'm totally not coping with the fact that i'm too stupid to use it
