# stats girl bot

just a small bot meant for friends

because they are stupid

and don't know how to be good at life

all good though

## current uses

- discord.js
- node.js
- sqlite3

## planned uses

- google translate
- chartjs with quickchart.io



## a true upgrade from banobot

- actually works
- actually organized (sort of)
- actually good (not really though)
- actually has and makes use of a database
- actually has a good command handler
- actually has a good event handler

## sad

typescript sucks
don't ever use it
please don't
i'm begging you
i'm totally not coping with the fact that i'm too stupid to use it
